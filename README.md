As I continue my journey to become a first-class front-end developer, I'm learning that building efficient, scalable, and performant websites is among my main priorities. Turns out there's a lot of tools a developer can use. This repo demonstrates my introduction to and use of three essential tools for achieving this: JAMStack, Eleventy, and Nunjucks.

I was introduced to these concepts by one of my mentors who wanted me to get experience with static site generators. What resulted is something I pulled together that focuses on my interest in the Beach Boys and their music.

One very cool outcome of this exercise was my use of parallax scrolling. Check it out. It can be seen by clicking on the "Wax Stack" and "Snapsicles" links. Love parallax scrolling!

<!-- Here is an image that shows the top of the snapsicles page:

As you scroll down the page, you will see parallax motion of images of the Beach Boys spanning from 1961 to 1969.

For those who want a high-level view of JAMStack, Eleventy, and Nunjucks, I created a mini explanation below. Here also is a link to a good online tutorial where the instructor turned static HTML and CSS into a blog with CMS using the JAMStack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wD00RT6d-g.

### Why JAMStack?

JAMStack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It's a web development approach that prioritizes speed, security, and scalability. Here's what makes it great:

- Blazing Fast: Content is pre-rendered, resulting in lightning-fast load times.

- Fort Knox Security: Fewer moving parts mean a smaller attack surface for hackers.

- Scales Like a Boss: Handles massive traffic spikes with ease.

- Cost-Effective: Less server infrastructure translates to lower maintenance costs.

### Eleventy: Your Static Site Generator BFF

Eleventy is a powerful static site generator (SSG) that works seamlessly with JAMStack. It allows you to:

- Craft beautiful websites: Build dynamic and engaging web experiences.

- Embrace templates: Create reusable templates for consistent layouts and design.

- Work with Nunjucks: Leverage Nunjucks for data-driven content within your templates.

### Nunjucks: Templater Extraordinaire

Nunjucks is a templating engine that empowers you to:

- Write familiar code: Use JavaScript-like syntax for easy template creation.

- Dynamic Magic: Generate content based on data, enabling flexible web pages.

- JAMStack Champion: Perfectly complements Eleventy's SSG capabilities.

- In short, this project is built for speed, security, and a delightful developer experience.
